# AI Trainer with computervision

This is a prototype for an AI Personal Trainer project using cv2 and the pose module from mediapipe. 
This code is responsible for counting push-ups by detecting the movements of the user's arm landmarks detected by the mediapipe pose module.
There are a lot of upgrades that can be made to avoid any way to cheese the counter but I believe this is a nice starting point and a good foundation for this idea.
Sounds like something fun to be implemented in games like Wii sports or kinect sports to motivate people to treat exercising as a fun game.

Below is a small demonstration of the code at work using a video from the site pexels.
